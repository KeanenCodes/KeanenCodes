- 👋 Hi, I’m @KeanenCodes
- 👀 I’m interested in a new career path. I have always wanted to learn how to code, so I am starting that journey now!
- 🌱 I’ve currently been learning Python as my first programming language. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects, though I am very new to coding, so learning the basics of Python are my main focus.
- 📫 How to reach me is very simple. Whether you'd like to DM on here or email me, either way works just fine.
